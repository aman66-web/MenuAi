# Progress

Claude: update this file at the end of every milestone session — tick what's done, note
decisions that differ from the spec (and why), and list known issues. Keep it short.

## Web app (current focus: web first, see docs/WEB_BUILD_PLAN.md)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| W0 Plan, sample menus for web | done | `web/public/menus-sample/`, `scripts/build_web_samples.sh` |
| W1 Domain core (TypeScript) | done | `web/lib/mm/`; golden ranking cases + every sample variation reproduced |
| W2 Client state + menu store | done | localStorage stores, outbox, menu client with SHA-256 check |
| W3 Shell, onboarding, Home, Search | done |  |
| W4 Chain page, item detail | done |  |

## Decisions log

- 2026-10-05 — Backend = Vercel (website, menu hosting, API in `web/`) + Supabase (database in
  `supabase/`) — founder's choice. The app talks only to the Vercel API; reports, chain requests and
  Contact us go through an outbox (SPEC §12) instead of email. See docs/BACKEND.md.
- 2026-10-05 — **Web app first** (founder's call). Built in `web/` at `/app`; the native iPhone app (M0–M10)
  comes later and can reuse the tested TypeScript domain logic as a second reference. Differences from the
  spec are in docs/WEB_BUILD_PLAN.md: no nearby chains (no privacy-safe POI search on the web), no Apple
  Health, no StoreKit (payments not wired; paywall is honest and Pro is previewable in non-production),
  no trial-reminder notification, analytics is an interface only.
- 2026-10-05 — Sample chains reach the web app from `web/public/menus-sample/` and are shown only when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_SAMPLE_DATA=1` or the build isn't production; real chains come from `web/public/menus/`.
- 2026-10-05 — Supabase: the first account's free plan was full (2 active projects), so the founder connected a new
  account. Project `menumacros` (ref rbbalkfkpacazzhsqfzz, org "Aman's Org", free plan, us-east-1) now exists with
  both migrations applied, `supabase/tests/security_and_constraints.sql` passing (ALL CHECKS PASSED, rolled back, tables
  empty) and RLS on every table. SUPABASE_URL is set in Vercel (Production + Preview). **Still missing: the secret
  key** — the connection can't read it, so the founder adds it in the dashboards (see Founder to-do). Vercel project
  `menumacros` (root `web`, linked to aman66-web/MenuAi) exists.
- 2026-10-05 — Web app deviations beyond docs/WEB_BUILD_PLAN.md: (1) onboarding step 3 asks which foods to avoid
  (the spec's location step has no web equivalent); (2) paywall bullet "Log to Apple Health in one tap" became "Keep a
  log of what you eat today" (Apple Health doesn't exist on the web); (3) light-mode accent darkened from #D9481E to
  #C0360F so text and white-on-accent buttons pass WCAG AA (4.3:1 → 5.6:1); dark mode unchanged; (4) chain, item and
  builder are static shells that read ids from the query string (`/app/chain?id=…`), so one cached shell opens any
  restaurant offline; (5) the 4th Save shows the paywall at 3 free saved orders exactly as in the spec.
- 2026-10-05 — Web decisions from the independent spec review (all beyond the spec, so logged here):
  copy added that the spec doesn't give: nothingFits heading "Nothing here fits your meal budget. Closest options:",
  onboarding validation message, "Search restaurants and items" placeholder, the offline strip and /app/offline page;
  while payments are off the Best for you overlay reads "See your 5 best orders · Pro" and Today's button "See Pro"
  ("Try Pro free" returns with payments, there is no trial to promise).
  Outbox: a network-failed item is retried when the network returns, at most once a minute (counts toward the 5
  attempts, so a flapping connection can't burn them in a burst); 408 is retried like a network error; a sent item keeps
  no content (message/email/notes) and is dropped after a day; "Email instead" is a plain mailto (can't attach the photo,
  which is deleted when an item fails). The web Contact form sends `source: "web"`, `appVersion: "web 1.0"` (BACKEND.md).
  Behaviour: editing a saved order ("Save changes") updates it in place; undo restores the original id and date; naming
  adds "single X" when a default recipe's double is reduced; onboarding runs first on every route and returns to the
  shared link; the browser is asked to keep our data when the user first saves or logs (iPhone Safari can evict site
  data after about a week; privacy/terms say so); web Pro waitlist rows (`source = 'web-app-pro'`) are kept until
  Pro is ready (BACKEND.md routine); lists sort case-insensitively (ranking tie-breaks stay code-unit as specified).
  Known and accepted: dev tools (Pro preview toggle) are tied to NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_SAMPLE_DATA, so that variable must
  never be set on a public production site; Pro is client-side only until payments exist (real payments need a
  server-verified entitlement).
- 2026-10-05 — Vercel project `menumacros` has env vars IP_HASH_SALT and CRON_SECRET (sensitive) and
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_SAMPLE_DATA=1 on Preview only, SUPABASE_URL on both. Still to set: SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY,
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.
- 2026-10-05 — User-facing name comes from `AppConfig.appName` (currently "Menu Math") — name not final.

## Known issues

- Web: no nearby chains and no Apple Health (by design, see WEB_BUILD_PLAN.md); payments not wired.
- Web offline: item/chain pages work offline after one online visit (the service worker precaches the shells and the menus are cached on first load); the first visit needs a connection.
- `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` M0–M10 (native iPhone app) are untouched and still planned.

## Founder to-do (things Claude can't do)

- [ ] Real bundle ID prefix, Team, App Group ID in Xcode signing and `AppConfig.swift`
- [ ] Xcode: iPhone-only destination, iOS 17.0 minimum, capabilities (App Groups, HealthKit, In-App Purchase), shared scheme
- [ ] App Store Connect: app record, subscription group, both products, 7-day trial offer
- [ ] Vercel + Supabase set up (docs/SETUP_VERCEL_SUPABASE.md) → put the URLs in `AppConfig`
- [ ] Supabase secret key: Supabase › menumacros › Project Settings › API Keys › create a secret key (`sb_secret_…`) → Vercel › menumacros › Settings › Environment Variables → add `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (tick Sensitive; Production and Preview), then redeploy. Never paste it into chat or the app
- [ ] Payments for the web app (Stripe or RevenueCat Web Billing: both add a dependency/account; needs your decision)
- [ ] Domain + support email; Vercel Pro before the site is public
- [ ] Read the live /privacy and /terms pages and confirm every statement is true
- [ ] Real chain data in `data/source/` (keep the two sample folders; release builds use `--no-samples`)
- [ ] App icon and screenshots (the web app and PWA use a placeholder `M` icon in `web/public/icons/` and `web/app/icon.png`)
- [ ] Support email: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` in Vercel (the site defaults to support@example.com)
- [ ] Read /privacy and /terms again: they now also describe the web app (browser storage, offline cache, Pro waitlist)
